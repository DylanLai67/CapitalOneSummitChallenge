# My Solution
For this MindSumo Challenege, I utilized HTML and CSS to format and design my website. Additionally, I used Javascript to make my web application interactive by fetching data from National Park Service API. Finally, I used Github pages to deploy and siplay my work.

# Challenge Prompt
**Copied from MindSumo:** 
1. Let visitors search from a list of activities to do at different National Parks
    a. Visitors can click an activity and have the web app display all the National Parks tied to a specific activity
    b. After selecting a specific park, the app should pull up an informational page so the visitor can learn more about the park.
2. Have a feature on the web app where visitors can: 
    a.Retrieve data from park web cams based on which National Park(s) the user selects. Specifically, this feature should be able to display the non-streaming images collected from park web cams so a visitor can view them with ease.
